pre. each top level component will have an event listener registered for the "change" event to the store.
1. interaction with UI trigger a component method (either a prop or component exclusive method)
2. this method triggers an action method - within which you should interact with a server here or whatever
    - you also emit an action object to all registered stores
3. within your store, upon detecting an action you do data manipulation here.
4. then you emit the change event so that the component picks up on this and sets a new state (and tehreby updating the DOM)
